# Restocking Highlighter (Neopets)

This is the JSON file I use for highlighting restockable items in Neopets.  I have a separate Violentmonkey userscript that runs on every Neopets shop (https://www.neopets.com/objects.phtml + query strings that are searched in the script), but will not be committing that here for personal greed.

Currently, this JSON file is manually updated and maintained, hence the number of commits in the history.  The eventual goal is to create a UI and maintain a DB of sorts that allows better color customization and to automate adding and removing items based on restocking guides.

The file can be publicly fetched from [here](https://aj9ms.github.io/restocking-highlighter/restocking_data.json).
